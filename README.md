# TechMan

A console-based project has been developed to support and maintain an organisation's system environment. The application is intended for use by employees, system engineers, and heads of department, enabling them to manage and troubleshoot issues within the system environment. The project offers a user-friendly interface with intuitive features, streamlining IT processes within the organisation. The potential benefits include increased productivity, improved communication, collaboration, security, and system stability. The implementation of this project can greatly benefit any organisation seeking to improve their IT infrastructure and streamline internal processes.


To ensure smooth operations, organisations must consider factors such as the cost of downtime, employee skills, retention rates, overheads, and customer satisfaction. IT hardware is critical to employees' daily work, and any hardware failure can lead to productivity losses. That's why there is a separate department, the System Engineers Department, responsible for maintaining and supporting the hardware. If an employee encounters an issue, they must report it to the department, and the engineers will resolve it promptly. This approach ensures efficient repairs and maintenance, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.
